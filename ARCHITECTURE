Systems:
--------

* kevlar - Linode host
* bnsf - My workstation at home w/ tape drive
* csx - My laptop (I run VPN here to get to work)
* awvr - My workstation at the office

                 +------+
                 | awvr |--+
                 +------+  |
                           |
                  +-----+  |   +------+
                  | csx |----->| bnsf |-----> tape
                  +-----+  ^   +------+
                           |

1) sync-from-awvr runs by cron on bnsf:
       If awvr is reachable (meaning the VPN is up), it rsyncs
       awvr to a backup directory on bnsf.

2) sync-to-bnsf runs by cron on csx:
       If bnsf is reachable (meaning networking is up), it
       rsyncs itself to bnsf (including the awvr directory).

3) sync-from-kevlar runs by cron on bnsf:
       If kevlar is reachable (meaning it's up and we have some
       network connectivity), it rsyncs kevlar to a backup
       directory on bnsf.

4) to-tape is invoked manually on bnsf:
       It initializes the tape drive using /etc/stinit.def.  If
       there is a tape in the drive, it performs a backup of
       bnsf plus all the remote hosts that backed up to it.


Directory structure on bnsf:
----------------------------

bnsf backs up its directories primarily:
    /etc
    /root
    /home
    /usr/local
    /var
    /projects

This also includes /home/BACKUP which contains subdirectories per
hostname of each included system:
    awvr.bss.redhat.com
    csx.bos.burdell.org
    kevlar.burdell.org
