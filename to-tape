# modes as defined in /etc/stinit.def.  There are 4 modes in
# stinit and they map to device notes like this:
#
#     mode 1      /dev/st0
#     mode 2      /dev/st0l
#     mode 3      /dev/st0m [unused]
#     mode 4      /dev/st0a [unused]

# There are corresponding /dev/nstN[?] devices as well, which is what
# we use because those refer to the non-automatic-rewinding tape
# devices.
#
# The letters don't really make sense, but that's what they are.
